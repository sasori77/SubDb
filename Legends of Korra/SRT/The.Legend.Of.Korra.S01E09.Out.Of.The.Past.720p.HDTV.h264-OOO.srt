1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,172
Earth.

2
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:03,714
Fire.

3
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:05,262
Air.

4
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:06,728
Water.

5
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:12,246
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:14,770
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:22,530
The Avatar has been abducted

8
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:26,549
After Tarrlok arrested her friends, Korra
confronted the councilman in his chambers.

9
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,346
But the heated argument quickly turned
into an all-out bending battle!

10
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:33,640
Desperate to save himself, Tarrlok revealed his ability to bloodbend

11
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,391
and took Korra far from Republic City.

12
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,989
Will the Avatar's friends find
her before it's too late?

13
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:44,255
Book one
Chapter nine: Out of The Past

14
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:12,715
What are you doing?

15
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:14,535
Tarrlok!

16
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,505
You can't keep me in here forever!

17
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:48,998
Who is this? It's six in the morning!

18
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,397
This better be important!

19
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,235
Councilman Tenzin here.

20
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:56,337
What?!

21
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,147
What happened?

22
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:10,860
What was Korra doing at City Hall?

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,345
As I told Chief Saikhan,

24
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:15,651
Korra came to my office last night.

25
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:18,381
She was upset that I arrested her friends.

26
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,668
She asked me to release them and-

27
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:22,950
that's when the Equalist's attacked.

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,821
I tried to protect Korra.

29
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:28,987
We were outnumbered,

30
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,400
then, I was electrocuted.

31
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:37,184
When I came to, the police had arrived.

32
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:38,790
But Korra was gone.

33
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,304
I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:43,250
Chief Saikhan, mobilize
the entire police force.

35
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,652
We have to find the Avatar.

36
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:51,841
We interrupt your regularly scheduled
broadcast to bring you this special report.

37
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,835
 Late last night, Equalists
attacked City Hall,

38
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:57,442
subduing Councilman Tarrlok
and capturing Avatar Korra.

39
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:58,925
Details are still coming in, b-

40
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,758
Hope you got enough beauty rest.

41
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:32,736
Come on, I'm busting you out.

42
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:34,410
Thanks. I owe you.

43
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:39,311
Are you done yet?

44
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,949
Cover your ears! I can't
go with you listening.

45
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,085
Asami!

46
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:49,109
A little privacy, please!

47
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,329
Are you all right?

48
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,639
I'm fine! It's so good to see you.

49
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,465
Hate to break up your lovers' reunion,

50
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:56,019
 but Korra's in trouble.

51
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,187
Amon captured her.

52
00:03:58,401 --> 00:03:59,279
No.

53
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:01,881
No, she can't be gone!

54
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:04,103
Come on, we have an Avatar to rescue.

55
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:09,539
Your fly was down.

56
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,196
Thanks for catching that.

57
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:19,989
Somebody!

58
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,046
Help!

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,990
Please!

60
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,287
Please.

61
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:32,743
I urge you to meditate on these visions.

62
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,809
I believe Aang's spirit is
trying to tell you something.

63
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,601
What are you doing here, Aang?

64
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:53,099
I told you, I have this under control.

65
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,713
Under normal circumstances,
I wouldn't get involved,

66
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:59,195
but if what those victims said is true,
we're not dealing with a normal criminal.

67
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:02,049
Fine. Follow me, Twinkletoes.

68
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,351
Toph, I'm forty years old. Do you think
you could stop with the nicknames?

69
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,717
'Fraid not.

70
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,725
It's over! You're under
arrest, Yakone!

71
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:17,555
What is Republic City coming to?

72
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:20,955
Used to be, a man could
enjoy his lunch in peace.

73
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,559
What's the big idea?

74
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:29,113
We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone.

75
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,479
We know what you are.

76
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,729
Take him away.

77
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:35,671
I've beaten every trumped-up charge
you yahoos have brought against me.

78
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:38,445
 And I'll beat this one, too!

79
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,789
Woah.

80
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:43,768
I finally connected with you, Aang.

81
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:47,061
But- what are you trying to tell me?

82
00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:49,327
A way out of this box would be nice.

83
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,215
I have to go.

84
00:05:57,553 --> 00:05:59,867
Call me back the minute you hear anything.

85
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,461
Lin? Wh-wh-what What are y-

86
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,713
You should be in the hospital!

87
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:05,713
And you three! You should be in prison!

88
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:08,008
I figured you could use
our help finding Korra.

89
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,246
Do you have any leads?

90
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:12,376
I've been on the phone all
morning, but- nothing yet.

91
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:13,774
We need Naga!

92
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:14,912
She can track Korra.

93
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:17,712
I'm afraid her polar bear
dog is missing as well.

94
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,085
Then where do we start?

95
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,830
My guess is the Equalists
are hiding underground,

96
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,364
in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.

97
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:25,650
Underground...

98
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,212
just like my father's secret factory.

99
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:29,174
Figures.

100
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:30,908
Yeah! Yeah, that makes sense!

101
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:34,652
When those chi-blockers had me in their truck,
it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!

102
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,908
I know where to start looking!
Come on!96

103
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,978
Wherever Amon is keeping Korra,

104
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:42,478
I bet that's where my officers are too.

105
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,724
Let's bring them all home, Lin.

106
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,913
The truck with Bolin took
off down this alley.

107
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,339
Which way?

108
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:07,250
Hmm. This way kinda...
smells familiar.

109
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:12,756
There's a tunnel nearby.

110
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,842
There!

111
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,398
Motorcycle tracks.

112
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,451
Korra has to be in there...

113
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,391
somewhere.

114
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:35,904
Let's try this way.

115
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:37,814
And what if Korra's not down there?

116
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:39,656
Then we pick another
tunnel until we find her!

117
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,238
Hey, is Mako all right?

118
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,455
He seems
really worried about Korra.

119
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:52,285
Yeah, we all are!

120
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:53,840
I know, but-

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,242
he's your brother. Do you think that he
likes Korra as more than just a friend?

122
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:02,873
W-What!? No! That's- just
gossip, where'd you hear that?

123
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,159
Crazy talk is coming outta
your mouth right now. Heh...

124
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:09,906
What do you know, Bolin?
Come on, spill it.

125
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,915
Nothing! I mean-

126
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:15,849
there was this one time during the
tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but-

127
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,783
They- kissed?

128
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:22,041
Believe me, I was upset too, but- I'm over it.
I don't think it meant anything.

129
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:23,999
I doubt that.

130
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:30,103
Hide!

131
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:04,477
That tram goes to the training camp.

132
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,337
Everything was delivered
to the prison, sir.

133
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,959
That's where they must be keeping Korra.

134
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,489
We need to get down that tunnel.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,606
It's empty?!
Yeah, I can see that.

136
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,908
You two, keep an eye on them.

137
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:53,662
My officers are inside.

138
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,084
What about Korra?

139
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,310
I don't see her yet.

140
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:15,433
Avatar Korra. Where
are you keeping her?

141
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,050
Chief Beifong?

142
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,426
I'm too late.

143
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:28,604
That monster already took
your bending, didn't he?

144
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,555
I'm so sorry.

145
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:34,905
Come on, let's gets you out of here.

146
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,555
I'll ask you one more time;

147
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,101
where is she?

148
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:43,819
We don't have the Avatar, and the
Equalists didn't attack City Hall.

149
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:44,997
Tarrlok's lying.

150
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,099
What?

151
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,869
I scanned the entire prison.
Korra's not here.

152
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:52,139
Why would Tarrlok make up a
story about getting attacked?

153
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,561
Because he has Korra.

154
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:55,709
He fooled us all!

155
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,173
Let's go, people!

156
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,834
Try to chi-block that, fools!

157
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:29,884
We got more company!

158
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,539
Yakone has ruled Republic City's
criminal empire for years.

159
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,109
Yet he has always managed to stay
out of the law's reach

160
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:04,455
until now.

161
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,983
You will hear testimony
from dozens of his victims

162
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:17,486
and they will tell you Yakone has maintained his grip on the underground
world by using an ability that has been illegal for decades.

163
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,590
Bloodbending.

164
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:24,637
The prosecution's entire case

165
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:30,907
is built upon the make-believe notion that
my client is able to bloodbend at will,

166
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,905
at any time on any day.

167
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:38,587
I remind to council that bloodbending
is an incredibly rare skill

168
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,835
and it can only be performed
during a full moon.

169
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:48,269
Yet, the witnesses will claim that my client
used bloodbending at every other time

170
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,580
except during a full moon.

171
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:58,166
It would be a mockery of justice to convict a
man of a crime that is impossible to commit.

172
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:09,302
Councilman Sokka will now
deliver the verdict.

173
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:14,543
In my years, I've encountered people born
with rare and unique bending abilities.

174
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:20,481
I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang
who was able to firebend wih his mind.

175
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:24,259
Why, even metalbending was considered
impossible for all of history

176
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:30,219
until our esteemed Chief of Police, Toph
Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill.

177
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:38,027
The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced
this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders

178
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:41,973
and he exploited his ability to
commit these heinous crimes.

179
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:49,391
We find Yakone guilty of all charges
and sentence him to life in prison.

180
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,132
Thank you all for meeting
us on such short notice.

181
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:31,214
Chief.
Lin.

182
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,604
Have you got any news on Avatar Korra?

183
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,658
We do.
You kidnapped her, Tarrlok!

184
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:40,240
I am shocked you would accuse
me of such an evil act!

185
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,574
I'd already explained, Equalists
attacked and took her!

186
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,172
But there were no Chi
blockers here last night.

187
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,302
You planted the evidence, didn't you?

188
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:50,820
That is a ridiculous accusation!

189
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,510
It's true! He took her!

190
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:56,316
 I was here when Avatar Korra
arrived last night, but

191
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:58,922
Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave.

192
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:01,632
I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok
bring her down to the garage.

193
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:05,512
Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra.

194
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:07,198
You'll never see it again.

195
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,977
Everyone know you're nothing but
a scrawny squeaky-voiced liar!

196
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:20,151
Why did you wait until now to 'fess up?

197
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,157
I was terrified to tell because...

198
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:24,795
Because Tarrlok is a Bloodbender!

199
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:26,617
He bloodbent Avatar Korra!

200
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:31,101
Don't make this worse for yourself.
Tell us where you have Korra.

201
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:58,851
Wake up!

202
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:07,813
Urgh! Man! I had this awful dream that Korra
was taken by this evil bloodbender. So weird.

203
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:10,695
Bolin, that really happened.
He knocked us out.

204
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,669
Are you serious?! Where is he?
Is he right now?

205
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,923
Tarrlok is long gone. 
I'll alert the whole force.

206
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,331
We've only been out for a little while.

207
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:21,406
Maybe we can still pick up Tarrlok's trail.

208
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:24,392
It could lead us to Korra! Let's go.

209
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:58,233
Yakone. You won't get away with this!

210
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:05,793
Republic City's mine, Avatar. I'll
be back one day to claim it.

211
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,928
This time I'm gonna put
you to sleep for good!

212
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:15,786
I'm taking away your bending- for good.

213
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:27,343
It's over.

214
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,775
Aang,

215
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:35,173
this whole time. You were trying
to warn me about Tarrlok.

216
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:41,505
My life is a disaster
now, thanks to you.

217
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,655
So your little
bloodbending secret's out?

218
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:48,655
And I know how you bloodbent
me without a full moon

219
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:50,921
You're Yakone's son.

220
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:53,769
I was his son,

221
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:56,019
but in order to win Republic City,

222
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,905
I had to become someone else.

223
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:03,465
My father failed because he tried to rule
the city from its rotton underbelly.

224
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,839
My plan was perfect.

225
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:10,364
 I was to be the city's savior.
But you-

226
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:13,030
you ruined everything!

227
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,948
Tarrlok, the jig is up and
you have nowhere to go.

228
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:20,766
Oh no. No, I'll escape
and start a new life.

229
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:24,090
And you are coming as my hostage.

230
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:26,072
You'll never get away with this!

231
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:33,344
Amon!

232
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:37,344
It is time for you to be equalized.

233
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:42,102
You fool! You've never
faced bending like mine.

234
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:58,062
What-

235
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:59,841
what are you?

236
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,734
I'm a solution.

237
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:21,603
I'll take care of him. You
four retrieve the Avatar.

238
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,393
Do not underestimate her.

239
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:27,510
 Electrocute the box to knock
her out before you open it.
My pleasure.

240
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,037
It's payback time.

241
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,247
Open the box.

242
00:20:58,401 --> 00:20:59,529
Tie her up.

243
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,766
I thought I told you not
to underestimate her.

244
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:07,770
Naga.

245
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,363
You came looking for me.

246
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:11,009
Good girl.

247
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,506
That sounds like Naga!

248
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,196
Down there!

249
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:37,078
Korra!

250
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:39,228
Oh, thank goodness.

251
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:40,346
Where's Tarrlok?

252
00:22:40,346 --> 00:22:41,724
 How did you get away?

253
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:43,106
Give her some space!

254
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:51,556
I was so worried.

255
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:52,816
Are you all right?

256
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:53,970
I'm fine.

257
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,466
I'm glad you're here.

258
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:03,312
You're safe now.
