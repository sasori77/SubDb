00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,772
Ziemia.

00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:34,314
Ogieñ.

3
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:35,862
Powietrze.

4
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:37,328
Woda.

5
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:42,847
<i>Tylko Avatar mo¿e opanowaæ
wszystkie cztery ¿ywio³y</i>

6
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:45,370
<i>i zaprowadziæ równowagê na œwiecie.</i>

7
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:53,296
Wojna w Republic City.

8
00:00:53,396 --> 00:00:56,971
Po odkryciu, ¿e jej ojciec,
Hiroshi Sato, wspó³pracuje z wrogiem,

9
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,921
Asami zwróci³a siê przeciwko niemu.

10
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,457
Po kolejnej pora¿ce 
w walce z Equalistami,

11
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:04,383
Lin Beifong zrezygnowa³a z funkcji 
naczelnika si³ policyjnych.

12
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:06,519
Equaliœci wci¹¿ wzrastaj¹ w si³ê.

13
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:10,583
Kto pomo¿e Avatarowi powstrzymaæ Amona
i przywróciæ równowagê w mieœcie?

14
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:13,821
Ksiêga Pierwsza
Rozdzia³ 8: Spotkanie przeciwieñstw

15
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:27,976
W koñcu jesteœcie.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,444
Witajcie na Wyspie Œwi¹tyni Powietrza.

17
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:33,778
Waszym nowym domu.
Tak, witajcie w moim domu.

18
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:37,150
Ale z ciebie ma³y s³odki ch³opiec.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,493
Co to za dziwne stworzenie?

20
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:43,242
To ognista fretka,

21
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:47,616
pospolity nadrzewny ssak zamieszkuj¹cy 
lasy bambusowe na po³udnie od Królestwa Ziemii.

22
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,922
Prawda, ¿e jest s³odki!

23
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,680
Hip hip, leæ bizonie, leæ!

24
00:01:57,168 --> 00:02:00,062
Dziêkujê za wys³anie nam 
pomocników do przeprowadzki.

25
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,500
Tak, byli wspaniali.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,642
Niestrudzeni pracownicy.

27
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,087
Widzê, ¿e zabra³aœ kilka rzeczy.

28
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:08,916
Uwierz mi, mog³o byæ gorzej.

29
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,908
Nie ma problemu, 
jesteœcie tutaj mile widziani.

30
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,468
Jesteœ ³adna. Mogê dotkn¹æ twoich w³osów?

31
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:25,316
Wygl¹da na to, ¿e mam konkurencjê

32
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,098
Pora na oprowadzenie was.

33
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,604
Lataj¹ce bizony ¿yj¹ 
w tych jaskiniach na dole.

34
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:32,252
A to jest œwi¹tynia, któr¹ wybudowa³ pradziadek Aang.

35
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,564
A w tym szarym domu jest jadalnia.

36
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,312
Mam kilka pytañ.

37
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,580
Czy to wszystko na tej wyspie?

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,682
Czy to tutaj trenujecie magiê powietrza?
Czy bêdziemy siê musieli ubieraæ jak ci pomocnicy?

39
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:44,348
Czy ka¿dy z nas dostanie lataj¹cego bizona?
I ostatnie pytanie, ile jest drzew na tej wyspie?

40
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,889
Tak, tak, nie, nie, 10 552.

41
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:52,310
Wiêc gdzie siê zatrzymamy?

42
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,912
Jesteœ ch³opcem, ch³opcy 
zamieszkaj¹ w czêœci mê¿czyzn.

43
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:57,358
Z chêci¹ poka¿e wam sypialnie mê¿czyzn.

44
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,208
Jestem mê¿czyzn¹.

45
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:01,438
Meelo, dlaczego nie pójdziesz z ch³opakami?

46
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,353
Do zobaczenia wkrótce, piêkna dziewczyno.

47
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:08,179
Ikki i ja poka¿emy ci twój pokój, têdy.

48
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:16,864
Asami, wiesz, ¿e Korra lubi Mako?

49
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:24,804
Oh, uh, nie zdawa³am 
sobie z tego sprawy.

50
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,108
- Hej! 
- Spadaj, Ikki.

51
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:45,611
Wiêc... to twój pokój.

52
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,847
Wiem, ¿e wygl¹da nieco wiejsko w porównaniu 
do tego, w którym mieszka³aœ na codzieñ.

53
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:52,557
Myœlê, ¿e jest naprawdê uroczy,
a najwa¿niejsze jest to,

54
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:54,866
¿e nie przypomina mi mojego ojca.

55
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:57,291
Dziêkujê za goœcinê.

56
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:00,763
Ikki, przysiêgam, ¿e jeœli 
nie zostawisz nas w spokoju...

57
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:05,551
Tenzin! WejdŸ, proszê.

58
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:08,702
Dzieñ dobry, moje panie.
Asami, witaj na wyspie.

59
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,888
Dziêkujê za pomoc.

60
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:16,715
Beifong zosta³a zast¹piona przez Saikhana. 
Bêdzie og³oszony nowym szefem si³ policyjnych.

61
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,633
Myœlê, ¿e powinniœmy to zobaczyæ.

62
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,718
To by³ zaszyt pracowaæ dla 
naczelnik Beifong tyle lat.

63
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:26,179
¯yczê jej szybkiego powrotu do zdrowia.

64
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:30,641
Z wielk¹ pokor¹ przejmujê jej 
miejsce jako nowy szef policji.

65
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,431
Republic City stoi w obliczu zagro¿enia,
którego œwiat jeszcze nie widzia³.

66
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,399
Ale jest cz³owiek, który potrafi³ skutecznie 
walczyæ z Amonem, to radny Tarlokk.

67
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:47,497
Dlatego w ka¿dej sprawie zwi¹zanej z Equalistami,
bêdê zwraca³ siê bezpoœrednio do niego.

68
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:54,101
Si³y policyjne dostarcz¹ wszystkiego co potrzebne, 
by wesprzeæ radnego i jego si³y specjalne.

69
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:56,265
Dopóki sytuacja siê nie uspokoi.

70
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:59,243
Co ten krêtacz Tarlokk kombinuje?

71
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:09,353
Tarlokk, nie wiem w jaki sposób
trzymasz Saikhana w garœci,

72
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,367
ale w¹tpiê, czy to jest zgodne z prawem.

73
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,437
Oh Tenzin, zawsze masz jakieœ teorie spiskowe.

74
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:20,147
Mo¿e Saikhan poprostu dostrzeg³ moje dzia³ania 
i chce tego, co dla miasta najlepsze?

75
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,857
Wow, Avatar Korra, d³ugo siê nie widzieliœmy.

76
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:30,291
Teraz, gdy ju¿ twoje zawody Pro-bendingu siê zakoñczy³y,
liczê na twój powrót do moich si³ specjalnych.

77
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:35,285
Zapomnij, nie przyst¹piê ponownie 
do twojego pró¿nego projektu.

78
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:40,968
Niemi³o jest mi to s³yszeæ, ale mam nadziejê, 
¿e zmienisz zdanie, tak jak ju¿ to raz zrobi³aœ.

79
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:45,549
Tenzin nie myli³ siê w stosunku do ciebie.

80
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:49,563
Manipulowa³eœ mn¹, mainipulowa³eœ Beifong
a teraz manipulujesz nowym naczelnikiem.

81
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:55,129
Mam dla ciebie wiadomoœæ. Ty potrzebujesz mnie,
ale ja nie potrzebujê ciebie. Jestem Avatarem.

82
00:05:55,129 --> 00:06:02,423
Nie do koñca, jesteœ raczej nieca³kowiecie wyszkolonym Avatarem.

83
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:06,834
Jak tam twoje treningi magii powietrza.

84
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:10,048
Zrobi³aœ jakiœ znacz¹cy postêp?

85
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,342
Tak myœla³em.

86
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:18,428
Jeœli nie chcesz byæ czêœci¹ moich si³ specjalnych,
najlepiej zrobisz nie wchodz¹c mi w drogê.

87
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:25,764
Nie rozumiem, co jest z mn¹ nie tak.

88
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,378
Pozna³am praktycznie wszystkie ruchy,

89
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:33,187
ale nie mogê wytworzyæ choæby 
ma³ego podmuchu powietrza. Jestem pora¿k¹.

90
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:37,272
Wcale nie. Musisz siê prze³amaæ.

91
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,966
Wspania³a porada. Od razu mi pomog³a.

92
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,905
Nie skoñczy³em jeszcze.

93
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:45,021
Widzisz, Aang nie tylko 
korzysta³ z rad swoich nauczycieli.

94
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,047
ale te¿ z doœwiadczeñ 
swoich by³ych wcieleñ.

95
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:50,661
Mia³aœ kiedyœ kontakt ze swoimi 
wczeœniejszymi wcieleniami?

96
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:55,123
Nie, oczywiœcie, ¿e nie. Nie dowiadzia³eœ
siê tego od Bia³ego Lotosu?

97
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,981
Jestem te¿ duchow¹ pora¿k¹.

98
00:06:56,981 --> 00:07:00,067
Mog³aœ mieæ kontakt bez zdawania sobie z tego sprawy.

99
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,675
Byæ mo¿e uzna³aœ, ¿e to by³ sen.

100
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:09,885
Mo¿e. Mia³am kilka dziwnych halucynacji, 
ale ciê¿ko jest mi sobie je przypomnieæ.

101
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:13,427
Did you see any of the previous
Avatars in these visions?

102
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:17,252
I saw Aang. It seemed like he was in trouble.

103
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,754
What do you think it means?

104
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:25,872
I don't know. But I urge you
to meditate on these visions.

105
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:29,728
I believe Aang's spirit must be
trying to tell you something.

106
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:44,461
Korra.Are you out here?

107
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:51,593
Korra!

108
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,637
Here you are.

109
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:57,499
Are you okay?

110
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,601
I'm fine.

111
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:02,153
Come on, what's wrong?
You can tell us.

112
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:08,317
How am I supposed to save this city, when I can't even learn airbending?

113
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:13,113
I'm the worse Avatar ever. I just feel...alone.

114
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:15,948
That's non-sense, you're amazing.

115
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:22,362
Yeah and remember, Aang hadn't mastered all the elements while
battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid.

116
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:25,301
And he wasn't alone, he had
his friends to help him.

117
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:27,556
Look the arena might
be shut down,

118
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:30,937
but we're still a team, the New Team Avatar!

119
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:35,275
We got your back Korra and we
can save the city, together.

120
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:38,040
Yeah, let's do it.

121
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,486
Yeah, let's do it!

122
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,740
What are we doing?

123
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:51,218
Get ready, Republic City.

124
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:55,010
You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.

125
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:59,280
Asami you always know how to accessorize your outfits.

126
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,576
I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon.

127
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:07,472
All right, let's ride.

128
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,104
Naga away!

129
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:14,834
Alright, scratch that, any other ideas?

130
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:18,560
Hmm. I think I have the answer.

131
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:32,870
You think this will do?

132
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,696
I like the New Team Avatar's style.

133
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:57,437
Unit 2-16 cancel that 10-58 in army
tower.Come back to the station, over.

134
00:09:57,437 --> 00:10:02,083
My dad had police scanners installed in
all his cars, I guess now I know why.

135
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,649
All available units, level four
alert, jailbreak at headquarters.

136
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:10,703
Officers down electric unit. Chi-blockers and Equalist
convoy are still at large armed and dangerous

137
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:15,549
last seen heading east. I repeat
level four alert Equalist jailbreak.

138
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:17,543
Chi-blockers!

139
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:19,081
Let's get them!

140
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,634
Korra, Bolin, give me a ramp now!

141
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,084
Hold me up, we got to make this turn.

142
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,543
They don't know we made the turn.

143
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:18,924
Get ready.

144
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,495
Avatar Korra, what do
you think you're doing?

145
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:16,568
Oh hey Tarlokk, nice for you to show up finally.
Here, we captured these escaped convicts for you.

146
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:21,526
What you did was tear up the city and impede the real
authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.

147
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:27,932
That's funny, I didn't see your little
task force or the cops the whole time.

148
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:31,382
If it wasn't for Team Avatar,
they would have gotten away.

149
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:35,500
This is your last warning,
stay out of my way!

150
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:43,967
Republic city stand as
a beacon of freedom,

151
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:47,910
but the Equalists are using
that freedom to tear it down.

152
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,725
The law I have proposed would make it illegal
for anyone to be a member of the Equalists

153
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,756
or even be associated with them.

154
00:12:55,472 --> 00:13:00,972
It also puts into effect a curfew insuring all
non-benders are in their own homes by night fall.

155
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:05,891
This is going too far Tarlokk, you can't punish
all non-benders for the actions of a few.

156
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:13,389
That kind of cowardness will cause our city to fall
into Amon's hands. We must pass this law.

157
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,425
All in favor.

158
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,077
All available unit please respond to
the 50-600 block at Dragon plattsburo.

159
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:43,375
Equalists have taken the street, consider them
armed and dangerous. Proceed with caution.

160
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:44,714
I'll go front.

161
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,805
After you.
What a gentlemen, thanks.

162
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:04,650
Why is the power out?

163
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,351
Wait a second, these people
aren't armed or dangerous.

164
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:24,401
It sure doesn't look that way.

165
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,608
All non-benders return to
your homes immediately.

166
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,552
Yeah, as soon as your
turn our power back on.

167
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:35,139
Disperse or you will all be arrested.

168
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:40,694
You benders can't treat us this way.
Mommy, look! It's the Avatar.

169
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,957
Please help us. You're our Avatar too.

170
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,225
Everyone please stay calm,
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

171
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:06,942
Tarlokk you need to turn the power
back on and leave these people alone.

172
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:10,285
Avatar Korra you and your
playmate have no business here.

173
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:15,259
We're not going anywhere. You don't have the right
to treat these innocent people like criminals.

174
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:18,579
This is an Equalist rally, there
isn't anything innocent about it.

175
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:22,570
They are not Equalist, they are just
normal people who wants their rights back.

176
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,337
They are the enemy. Rounds
up all these Equalists.

177
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,364
Stop!

178
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,967
Hey! Let me go.

179
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,300
You're under arrest.

180
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,382
What! You can't do that.

181
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:15,058
Yeah, I can. She's a non-bender out past curfew
and her father is a known Equalist conspirator.

182
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,376
Let her go.

183
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,608
Arrest him and his brother.

184
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,097
Tarlokk!

185
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:32,396
Unless you want to join your friends in prison, I suggest
you put those down and go back to the Air Temple.

186
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:35,464
Korra, listen to him, it's not worth it.

187
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:41,867
We'll be alright.

188
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,264
Don't worry I'll call Tenzin.
He can get you out.

189
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,239
So sad to see your little Team Avatar
broken up. You had a good run.

190
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,251
This isn't over Tarlokk.

191
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:04,086
Oh, I believe it is. Take them away.

192
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,559
Hey.
I came as fast as I could.

193
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:31,597
Are your friends alright?

194
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:34,388
I don't know, these knuckleheads
won't tell me anything.

195
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:36,499
I'll take care of this.

196
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:41,487
Saikhan, a word please?

197
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:45,880
Councilman Tenzin, I'm pretty swarmed at the moment.
Can this wait?

198
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:50,485
No it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's
friends were wrongly arrested tonight.

199
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,326
I'd like you to release
them immediately.

200
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:56,090
They're not going anywhere. They were
interfering with police business.

201
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,742
Your so-called police business was rounding up
innocent people and claiming they were Equalists.

202
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:02,949
They should be released too.

203
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:06,601
All Equalist suspects are
being detained indefinitely.

204
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:10,640
They'll be free, if and when the task force
deems they are no longer a threat.

205
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,523
Those people are entitled to
due process under the law.

206
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:16,079
You'll have to take that with
councilman Tarlokk.

207
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,774
Oh, I plan to. At the council
meeting, first thing in the morning.

208
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,776
You're officially the worse
chief of police ever!

209
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:28,242
Calm down, Korra. I'll get this sorted
out, we just need to be patient.

210
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,327
But you really are the worst...

211
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:34,185
ever.

212
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:54,399
Wake up Naga, let's go.

213
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:07,785
Wait for me here, girl.
Don't worry, I'll be alright.

214
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,841
You and I need to talk.

215
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,837
Are any of the other
council members here?

216
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:35,038
I believe everyone has
gone home for the night.

217
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,266
Then you should do the same.

218
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,294
Are you sure, sir?

219
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,562
Leave us.

220
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:49,939
You obviously have something on your mind.

221
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,222
Spit it out.

222
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:55,686
Don't you see? You're doing exactly
what Amon says is wrong with benders.

223
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,607
You are using your power to
oppress and intimidate people.

224
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:00,030
And you don't?

225
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,389
Of...of course not!

226
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,522
Isn't that what you came here to do?

227
00:20:04,522 --> 00:20:07,324
Intimidate me into releasing your friends?

228
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,920
See that's what I admire about you Korra.

229
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,555
Your willingness to go to extremes
in order to get what you want.

230
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:18,358
It is a quality we both share.

231
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,659
You and I are nothing alike.

232
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,595
Look, I'll make you a deal.

233
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:28,173
You fall in line and do what I say
and I'll release your friend.

234
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,083
That's why you arrested them? To get to me?

235
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:32,994
I need your answer.

236
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:38,646
No. You might be able to manipulate
chief Saikhan into following you,

237
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:40,117
but it won't work on me.

238
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,770
You will regret that decision.

239
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,946
You need to be stopped.
You're just as bad as Amon.

240
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,616
I've tried to work with you Korra,

241
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:54,062
but you have made it impossible.

242
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:45,598
Still think I'm a half-baked Avatar?

243
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:01,162
What are you gonna do now?

244
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:03,309
You're all out of water pal.

245
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,976
You're in my way, Avatar.

246
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:23,213
And you need to be removed.

247
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,667
You're...you're a...

248
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,378
bloodbender?

249
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,000
Very observant.

250
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:35,162
It's not a full moon.

251
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:38,092
How...how are you doing this?

252
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:41,029
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

253
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,210
Where are you taking me?

254
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,721
Somewhere where no one will find you.

255
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:09,007
Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra.

256
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,036
You'll never see it again.

257
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:19,828
You can't do this! Let me out!

258
